# Hi there, I'm Vico 👋  
### Agentic AI Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Data Enthusiast  

I'm a 4th semester Information Systems student at the University of Indonesia with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the development of **agentic AI**—intelligent autonomous systems that interact, reason, and act across diverse domains. Currently, I specialize as an **AI Engineer**, focused on building modular, scalable, and production-ready autonomous agents and digital solutions.

## 💡 What I Do

### 🧠 Agentic AI Engineering & Automation  
I design, build, and deploy AI-driven automation systems using cutting-edge tools such as **n8n**, **LangChain**, and **LLMs**. These systems automate workflows for:

- 🛠️ Business process & marketing automation  
- 📄 Document logging and summarization  
- 🏡 Intelligent home assistant systems  
- 🤖 AI-powered chatbots and voice interfaces  
- 📞 AI call centers with dynamic voice interaction  
- 🎬 Text-to-video generation pipelines  

I integrate LLMs with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using vector databases, and orchestrate agents to deliver real-world impact.

#### Tech Stack Highlights:
- **AI/LLMs**: LangChain, LangGraph, Prompt Engineering, OpenAI, Claude, HuggingFace  
- **Orchestration**: n8n, tool-calling, MCPs, reasoning chain configuration  
- **APIs**: OAuth 2.0, Postman  
- **RAG & Vector DBs**: Pinecone, Supabase vector  
- **Voice/Multimodal Interfaces**: ElevenLabs, Google Cloud TTS, WhatsApp Business API, Telegram Bot API
